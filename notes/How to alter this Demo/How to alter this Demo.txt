Welcome!

This game template aims to provide you with the starter project to make your own 2.5D game with a Z axis and jumping in GameMaker.

Here's what you need to know to use it:

1) Tile layers are key and they must follow the proper naming conventions. For a non-collision, non-depth sorted tile layer, use any name you prefer but do NOT include _
To have a tile layer be collideable, you must include _Z16 <---Add any number for where it lives on the Z axis, and then immediately after _H0 <--Add any number for its height.
The order of tiles in the room doesn't matter.

2) A player object needs to be created and called with the following scripts in this order:
Define_Player_Controls(ord("W"), ord("S"), ord("D"), ord("A"), vk_space);
Define_Player_Movement(3.5, -4.5, .25, 3);
Define_Tile_Layers(16, 16);
Define_Depth_Sorting();

These functions are defined in the script ZAxisGameTemplate, with descriptions of what to pass in when using these functions.

3) To get the camera to work properly, creat an object and put it in a blank room that runs when your game begins. Then have that object call these functions:
Define_Camera(1280, 720, 640, 360, false, 0.05);
room_goto(rmMainMenu); <--- Go to your real starting room here

And in its Room Start event, call:
Set_Camera();

This ensures the camera gets created.

Enjoy!
